   cycler
   Cycler
   concat

The public API of :py:mod:`cycler` consists of a class `Cycler`, a
factory function :func:`cycler`, and a concatenation function
:func:`concat`.  The factory function provides a simple interface for
creating 'base' `Cycler` objects while the class takes care of the
composition and iteration logic.
